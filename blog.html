            <h2>Local Storage Vs. Session Storage</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Local Storage : </b> Local storage maintains data across all instances of a site, whether they're in different tabs or windows. Unlike sessionStorage localStorage continues
                to store data after the browser is closed. It means that data stored
                in localStorage does not expire.
              </p>
            <p>
              <b>Session Storage : </b> The sessionStorage object stores data only
              for a session. It means that the data stored in the sessionStorage
              will be deleted when the browser is closed.

            <h2>Global Scope Vs. Block Scope</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Global Scope : </b> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Block Scope : </b> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.

            <h2>What is Event Loop?</h2>
            <p>
                The event loop is an architectural design pattern that allows code to run asynchronously on the javascript engines and makes it possible for code to execute blocking instructions first and when available execute asynchronous functions.
              It's a fundamental piece of the JavaScript engine
              that always monitor call stack, task queue and microtask queue. If
              the call stack is empty it puts callback function in call stact from
              task queues.

            <h2>When do we get undefined in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
              1. When value is not defined. <br />
              2. A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. <br />
              3. When a function does not return anything it return
                undefined.
              <br />
              4. When you try to access a property of an object that does not
                exist.
